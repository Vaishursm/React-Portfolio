## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Chakra UI
Used for layout and styling. Provides accessible, reusable components and built-in responsiveness.  
üîó [Chakra UI Documentation](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components)

### Formik & Yup
Formik handles form state and submission logic, while Yup validates user inputs with clear, user-friendly error messages.

### FontAwesome
Used for consistent iconography, particularly in the header navigation and project cards.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **Header**  
  Includes both social media icons and navigation links. Navigation is enhanced with smooth scroll behavior and a scroll-direction-sensitive animation that hides/shows the header.

- **Landing Section**  
  Features a profile avatar, greeting, and short role description. Layout is managed using Chakra's `VStack` and `Box` components.

- **Projects Section**  
  Displays a list of projects using a reusable `Card` component. Data is passed as props and arranged in a grid layout using Chakra‚Äôs layout utilities.

- **Contact Me Section**  
  A complete contact form with the following capabilities:
  - Validation using Yup
  - Submission using a custom `useSubmit` hook
  - Success/error alert using a context API
  - Form reset on successful submission
